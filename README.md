# Blargo: An Ad-Optimized News Theme for Wordpress

Blargo is a child theme of [Largo](https://github.com/INN/Largo). While Largo is
a great theme to get started, we wanted to make it even easier for new news
publishers to get started. It adds several features, and most importantly,
is ad-friendly.

It was build in partnership with the [New Jersey News Commons](http://njnewscommons.org/).

## Notable Features

Here are some features you get when you use Blargo:

- 2x 2-column layout with width optimized for IAB-standard ad sizes
- Fixed-width (with responsiveness) or fluid, full width layout
- The addition of an ad zone right of the logo (468x60)
- The addition of a "Monster" ad zone at the top of the page (728x90 or 960x?)
- Seamless integration with Broadstreet's ad manager (free under 100k monthly impressions)
- Built in ad zone widget
- Responsive styling of ads
- Several basic color schemes
- Ability to set a site background image/wallpaper
- Ability to set transparency on the content area
- More, like the tweaking of some unrefined largo styles

## Getting Started

1. Install the Blargo theme
2. Go to Admin Menu->Ad Management and follow the instructions
3. Go to the Widgets page and drag the Ad Zone widget to the widget areas where you would like ads to appear
4. Log into Broadstreet's dashboard and start uploading ads
